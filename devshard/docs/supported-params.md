# Chat Completions — supported parameters

Reference for `POST /v1/chat/completions` on devshard. Documents which OpenAI/vLLM request fields the gateway accepts today, which are rejected, how to use the ones that pass, and what we still need to tighten.

## Why a strict whitelist

vLLM crashes on malformed or pathological requests (deep recursive JSON Schema, unsupported routing fields, unbounded objects). To keep the inference node healthy:

1. **Body-level depth scan** (`ensureRequestNestingDepth` in `request_filters_parameters.go`). A byte-level pass bounds whole-request JSON nesting at `MaxRequestNestingDepth = 32` before `encoding/json` allocates anything. Rationale and the legitimate-request depth budget live in the code comment over the constant. This is a separate layer from the schema-level `MaxDepth = 5` cap below: the body limit is generous because legitimate requests stack ~10 levels of wrappers; the schema limit is tight because the grammar compiler is the actual attack surface.
2. Every inbound `/chat/completions` body is then decoded into a generic JSON document.
3. `VLLMParameterCatalog` (`devshard/cmd/devshardctl/request_filters_parameters.go`) is a closed allow-list. The set of allowed keys is precomputed at catalog construction (no per-request map build). Any top-level field that is not in the catalog is rejected with `feature "<name>" is temporarily unavailable` (HTTP 400) before the request reaches the model.
4. Parameter rules run in two stages:
   - `PreValidation` — on the raw document, before we decode/validate it.
   - `PostLimits` — after `max_tokens` defaults/caps are resolved.
5. The message validator (`request_filters_messages.go`) enforces the OpenAI-compatible message contract (roles, tool_call linkage, text-only content parts).
6. The chat-request projection (`chatRequest` — 5 fields: `model`, `stream`, `max_tokens`, `max_completion_tokens`, `n`) is populated by direct map reads from the document, not a `json.Marshal + Unmarshal` round-trip.

Anything not on this whitelist does not reach the model. That is the contract.

## Status at a glance

### ✅ Implemented

**Schema-walking validators** — same vLLM grammar-compiler attack surface. All apply depth/nodes/size/branch/enum bounds, ban `$ref`/`$defs`/`definitions`, validate `type` is a JSON-Schema primitive, and compile-check `pattern` regex with a length cap (defuses CVE-2025-48944):
- `response_format` — `paramvalidators.ResponseFormatValidator`
- `tools[].function.parameters` — `paramvalidators.ToolsValidator`
- `chat_template_kwargs` — `paramvalidators.ChatTemplateKwargsValidator` (plain object, no JSON-Schema semantics; additionally rejects keys that override `apply_hf_chat_template()` positional args: `chat_template`, `tokenize`, `tools`, `documents`, `conversation`, `continue_final_message`, `padding`, `truncation`, `max_length`, `return_tensors`, `return_dict` — defuses CVE-2025-61620 + CVE-2025-62426)

**Shape validators**:
- `thinking` — `paramvalidators.ThinkingValidator` (additionally mirrors the resolved boolean into `chat_template_kwargs.thinking` for `moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6`)
- `stream_options` — `paramvalidators.StreamOptionsValidator` (whitelist `include_usage`; strip `continuous_usage_stats` for vLLM-project/vllm#9028 + any other sub-field; drop the field if it empties out)
- `metadata` — `paramvalidators.MetadataValidator` (OpenAI bounds: ≤16 keys × 64-char keys × 512-char string values)
- `user` — `paramvalidators.UserValidator` (must be a string, byte-length ≤ 512)
- `safety_identifier` — `paramvalidators.SafetyIdentifierValidator` (must be a string, byte-length ≤ 512 — gateway-chosen cap mirroring `UserValidator`; OpenAI's [help-center page](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5428082-how-to-incorporate-a-safety-identifier) recommends short hashed identifiers but does not enforce a hard cap on their side). Per-model gated via `ModelScopedParameterHandler`: forwarded for `moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6` (Moonshot consumes the field for abuse tracking on their hosted backend), silently stripped for every other model. OpenAI is migrating end-user attribution from `user` to `safety_identifier` (same help-center page), so accepting the field keeps the gateway forward-compatible.
- `reasoning_effort` — `paramvalidators.ReasoningEffortValidator` (enum: `none|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh`). The enum is sourced from [vLLM `ChatCompletionRequest.reasoning_effort`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/main/vllm/entrypoints/openai/chat_completion/protocol.py) where the docstring states these values come from OpenAI's API specification (vLLM additionally accepts `"max"` as a DeepSeek V4 extension — we exclude it because no routed model is DeepSeek). The classic OpenAI reasoning concept is documented in the [OpenAI reasoning guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/reasoning). After enum validation the field is stripped via `ModelScopedParameterHandler{Models: nil}` — every currently-routed model is non-reasoning, so forwarding is a documented no-op on both backends ([Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507 model card](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507) — non-thinking-only; [Moonshot Kimi API](https://platform.kimi.ai/docs/api/chat) — schema lacks the field). Strip wiring must be revisited the moment a reasoning-capable model is added.
- `reasoning` — `paramvalidators.ReasoningValidator` (extracts `effort` from the [OpenRouter unified reasoning object](https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/best-practices/reasoning-tokens) and projects it onto top-level `reasoning_effort`; `enabled: false` is treated as an explicit opt-out and overrides any `effort`; `max_tokens` / `exclude` / `enabled: true` are dropped because they have no documented sink on our non-reasoning routes — `max_tokens` would map to Anthropic `budget_tokens` / Qwen `thinking_budget` / Gemini `thinkingBudget`, none of which apply, and `exclude` controls presentation of reasoning content the models don't emit). Wrapper is always removed after lift; top-level `reasoning_effort` wins on conflict.
- `enable_thinking` — `paramvalidators.EnableThinkingValidator` (bool type-check, then translates top-level `enable_thinking` into `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking` — the canonical Qwen3 placement per [Qwen vLLM deployment docs](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/vllm.html): *"passing enable_thinking is not OpenAI API compatible"*). Pre-existing `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking` wins. For Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507 the flag is a documented no-op (see model card above); the translation stays harmless and forward-compatible for future Qwen3-Thinking variants.
- `tool_choice` — `paramvalidators.ToolChoiceValidator` (shape-only: `"auto"` / `"none"` / function-object with ≤64 B name)

**Length / size caps**:
- `messages` (≤2048) · `stop` (≤16/256B) · `stop_token_ids` (≤64) · `bad_words` (≤64/128B) · `logit_bias` map (≤1024 entries)

**Numeric range sanitizers**:
- `temperature` (≤2.0) · `top_p` · `top_k` · `min_p` · `repetition_penalty` (≤2.0) · `n` (≤5) · `logit_bias` values (`[-100, 100]`) · `frequency_penalty` (`[-2, 2]`) · `presence_penalty` (`[-2, 2]`)

**Type validators**:
- `seed` — non-negative uint64
- `tool_choice` — `paramvalidators.ToolChoiceValidator` (shape-only after upstream coerce). Accepts `"auto"`, `"none"`, or `{"type":"function","function":{"name":"..."}}` (name ≤ 64 B). `"required"` is silently coerced to `"auto"` by `ToolsValidator` (temporarily disabled — see Coercions). Anything else gets a 400 with the shape error.
- `thinking` — `paramvalidators.ThinkingValidator`. Accepts `{"type":"enabled"|"disabled"}`. For `moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6` the validator additionally mirrors the resolved boolean into `chat_template_kwargs.thinking`; existing `chat_template_kwargs.thinking` wins.

**Coercions (no error, silent rewrite)**:
- `tool_choice` defaults to `"auto"` when `tools` is non-empty and the field is omitted (matches the OpenAI spec). Done by `ToolsValidator`.
- `tool_choice == "required"` is silently coerced to `"auto"` ("required" is temporarily disabled by network policy — re-enable by removing the coerce in `ToolsValidator.Validate`).
- `n` is coerced to `1` when `temperature == 0` — greedy sampling produces identical completions; vLLM rejects `n > 1` here, so we round it down silently instead of 400-ing
- **Kimi K2.6 only**: `frequency_penalty` and `presence_penalty` are force-rewritten to `0.0` via a `ModelScopedParameterHandler` catalog rule — Moonshot's K2.6 wire accepts the fields but rejects any non-zero value (model-side constraint, not security). Rewriting silently keeps OpenAI-clients that always emit these working. Other models (e.g. Qwen3-235B) get the catalog-level `[-2, 2]` clamp only.
- `tools[].function.strict` is stripped by `ToolsValidator` per tool. vLLM accepts the field but does not honor it (schema enforcement on tool arguments only flows through `tool_choice="required"`, not via `function.strict`); the kimi_k2 and hermes tool parsers ignore it. Stripping preserves wire compatibility with OpenAI clients (LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI SDK) without implying schema enforcement we cannot deliver. Restore the pass-through here if vLLM ever wires `function.strict` into xgrammar.
- **Silent-strip fields** — accepted by the catalog and deleted from the request before forwarding. No inference-side semantics on vLLM for any of these; rejecting outright broke widely-used clients while forwarding bare would imply the backend honors the field. Stripping at the gateway is the OpenAI-compatible no-op. Per-field rationale + official sources:
  - `service_tier` — OpenAI billing/latency tier routing, enum `auto`/`default`/`flex`/`priority` ([OpenAI Flex processing guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/flex-processing), [Priority processing guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/priority-processing)). vLLM has one queue; field not in [`ChatCompletionRequest`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/main/vllm/entrypoints/openai/protocol.py) schema, silently dropped by `extra='allow'` ([vLLM PR #10463](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/10463)).
  - `store` — OpenAI Stored Completions opt-in for distillation/evals ([OpenAI Chat Completions API reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create)). vLLM does not persist completions, so the field is a no-op regardless of value; forwarding it would create phantom-retention expectations for GDPR/audit pipelines.
  - `provider` — OpenRouter cross-provider routing object (`order`/`only`/`ignore`/`quantizations`/...) ([OpenRouter Provider Routing](https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/routing/provider-selection)). OpenRouter-edge-only; meaningless on a single-backend vLLM path.
  - `plugins` — OpenRouter edge-only plugin invocation (`web` search, `file-parser`, etc.) ([OpenRouter Plugins](https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/features/plugins), [Web Search plugin](https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/features/plugins/web-search)); never executed downstream by vLLM.
  - `prompt_cache_key` — first-class OpenAI Chat Completions field for prompt-cache routing/sharding hints ([OpenAI Chat Completions API reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create)); also documented as Moonshot Kimi's required context-cache tag for Kimi Code Plan tier ([Moonshot Chat Completion API](https://platform.kimi.ai/docs/api/chat)). The vLLM-served path does NOT honor it: vLLM uses a separate field name `cache_salt` for prompt-cache isolation ([vLLM RFC #16016 — Cache Salting](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/16016), shipped via [PR #17045](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/17045)), and a request to alias `prompt_cache_key` → `cache_salt` is open since Jan 2026 with no merged PR ([Issue #33264](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/33264)). Forwarding bare would give clients false cache-isolation guarantees in a domain with [published prompt-cache timing side-channel attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07776) ([NDSS 2025 PROMPTPEEK](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-1772-paper.pdf)). Restore as a real feature (hash → inject as `cache_salt`) only when multi-tenant cache isolation is in scope; for now `cache_salt` is a pure vLLM extension that no mainstream agent SDK (LangChain, LlamaIndex, LiteLLM, OpenAI Python/Node) emits — so there is no client demand to bridge.
  - `extra_body` — OpenAI Python SDK convention for inlining additional top-level fields into the request body. Per the SDK README's "Undocumented request params" section, `extra_body` is meant to be FLATTENED client-side into the JSON body before the HTTP call ([openai-python README: "Undocumented request params"](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/README.md#undocumented-request-params)). A literal `extra_body` field on the wire indicates either a non-flattening client (e.g. some LiteLLM passthrough configs — [LiteLLM #4769](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/issues/4769)) or hand-written code that copied the SDK construct verbatim into a raw HTTP body (e.g. the example in the [Kimi OpenAI → Kimi API migration guide](https://kimi-ai.chat/guide/openai-to-kimi-api/), which shows `extra_body={"thinking":{"type":"disabled"}}` in Python and is easy to misinterpret as a wire field). We **unwrap** rather than strip: a pre-pass in `VLLMParameterCatalog.Apply` lifts each key from `extra_body` to the top level of the document **before** `rejectUnknownParameters` runs. Lifted keys then pass through the catalog's normal validation — known fields (e.g. `thinking`) reach their validators, unknown fields surface as the standard 400. Top-level keys always win on conflict (no silent overwrite); nested `extra_body` inside `extra_body` is not lifted (no recursion / smuggling); non-object envelopes (`extra_body: "x"`, `null`, `[]`, `42`) are silently dropped. The OpenAI Node SDK does not use the `extra_body` convention at all — its README documents request-level `body`/`headers`/`query` options on `client.post()`.
  - `extra_headers` — OpenAI Python SDK convention for HTTP-level header injection, paired with `extra_body` / `extra_query` in the same "Undocumented request params" section ([openai-python README](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/README.md#undocumented-request-params)). Not a body field under correct SDK usage; should never reach our body validator at all. Strip-if-present is a defensive no-op for clients that accidentally serialize it into the body.
  - `thinking_config` — Google Gemini's native reasoning-control shape (`thinkingConfig: {thinkingBudget, includeThoughts}`, camelCase, nested under `generationConfig` per Google's API). Not in [OpenAI Chat Completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create), not in [OpenRouter unified parameters](https://openrouter.ai/docs/api/reference/parameters), not in [vLLM `ChatCompletionRequest` schema](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/main/vllm/entrypoints/openai/chat_completion/protocol.py), not in [Moonshot Kimi API](https://platform.kimi.ai/docs/api/chat). Silent-strip is the lowest-friction option: clients that mistakenly forward a Gemini snippet to our endpoint don't break, and there's nothing meaningful to map to on Kimi/Qwen3-Instruct.
- `safety_identifier` follows the same "strip elsewhere" pattern but is forwarded for `moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6` (see Shape validators).

**Pipeline / forced**:
- `max_tokens` / `max_completion_tokens` — defaults + caps via `applyOutputTokenLimits`
- `min_tokens` — conditional strip + clamp
- `thinking_token_budget` — per-model gated via `ModelScopedParameterHandler` at PreValidation: silently stripped for every non-Kimi model (no documented sink; observed to crash `vllm.v1.engine.exceptions.EngineDeadError` on Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507 when forwarded). For `moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6`: `paramvalidators.ThinkingTokenBudgetDefaultsValidator` injects `max_tokens / 2` when the client omits the field; `CapUintParameterHandler{Max: 96_000}` and `ClampUintToFieldParameterHandler{MaxField: "max_tokens"}` clamp the value (default-injected or client-supplied). Without the default, Kimi-K2.6 routinely consumes the entire `max_tokens` budget inside `<think>...</think>` and returns `finish_reason=length` with empty content at the current 4k cap. The 1:1 split self-balances at any size — a small `max_tokens` still leaves half for visible content (no floor, which would let reasoning eat the whole budget when `max_tokens` is tiny). Ceiling of 96 000 matches Moonshot's HLE/AIME reasoning budget.
- `logprobs` / `top_logprobs` — forced
- `messages` contract — `defaultChatMessageProcessor.ValidateDocument`
- Body-level: `MaxRequestNestingDepth=32`, `MaxChatRequestBodySize=10 MiB`

**Pass-through (safe by type contract)**:
- `model` · `stream` · `skip_special_tokens` · `detokenize` · `parallel_tool_calls`

### ❌ Open / not yet implemented

Field-level additions that Kimi K2/K2.6 actually accepts on the wire (per Moonshot's [chat reference](https://platform.kimi.ai/docs/api/chat) and [K2.6 quickstart](https://platform.kimi.ai/docs/guide/kimi-k2-6-quickstart)):

- **`messages[].reasoning_content`** — *required* on assistant turns during multi-step tool-calling when thinking is enabled. The message validator already does NOT reject unknown assistant-message fields (only `tool_call_id` is disallowed on assistant), so this already passes through. Just document the contract; no code change needed.

Structural additions:

- **Per-message content byte size cap** — currently bounded only by the 10 MiB body cap; no per-message structural limit. Token-limit logic downstream catches the most pathological cases.
- **Catalog → spec generator** — this doc is hand-written. `go generate` could derive the Supported table from `defaultVLLMParameterCatalog()` so it cannot drift.
- **Special-token literal sanitizer for `messages[].content`** (CVE-2026-44222) — literal strings like `<|vision_start|>` / `<|image_pad|>` / `<|vision_end|>` in user text crash multimodal models with an `IndexError` in `_vl_get_input_positions_tensor`. Required for `Kimi-K2.6` (multimodal) and any future VL routing. Implement as a content-text pass that strips or rejects the known special-token literals. ([advisory](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/GHSA-hpv8-x276-m59f))

Verification / operational:

These constraints are enforced by the vLLM engine configuration, not the gateway. The gateway cannot filter them — confirm on the serving side.

**Engine version**
- **Pin vLLM ≥ 0.20.0** — CVE-2026-44223 lets a single `repetition_penalty ≠ 1.0` (or any `frequency_penalty` / `presence_penalty`) crash EngineCore on vLLM 0.18.0–0.19.1 when `extract_hidden_states` speculative decoding is on. Confirm the deployed image's vLLM version before raising the cap on these fields. If the engine is older, the gateway must also reject `repetition_penalty ≠ 1.0` as a fallback. ([advisory](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/GHSA-83vm-p52w-f9pw))

**Tool-call parser selection (all served models)**
- **Disable `pythonic` tool-call parser** — CVE-2025-48887 catastrophic-backtracking ReDoS on the output path. The gateway can't block this; the engine must not run with `--tool-call-parser pythonic`. ([advisory](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/GHSA-w6q7-j642-7c25))

**Per-model operational requirements**

- **`Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507-FP8`**
  - Tool-call parser must be `hermes` (the model's default). Do NOT run with `--tool-call-parser qwen3_coder` — CVE-2025-9141 yields RCE via `eval()` on attacker-controlled tool arguments. The `qwen3_coder` parser is intended for `Qwen3-Coder` only. ([advisory](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/GHSA-79j6-g2m3-jgfw))
  - Speculative decoding with `extract_hidden_states` must be off (see vLLM version note above) — otherwise `repetition_penalty` (currently allowed by the gateway) becomes a one-shot kill (CVE-2026-44223).
  - Reasoning parser `qwen3` and hermes tool parser are known to surface 500s on certain Qwen3 output patterns (multiple JSON blobs, `<tool_call>` inside `<think>`). These are server-side parsing bugs the gateway can't prevent — they degrade availability, not security. Track upstream issues (see References).

- **`moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6`** (multimodal model — text + image + video; gateway policy serves it as text-only)
  - Per [Moonshot K2.6 quickstart](https://platform.kimi.ai/docs/guide/kimi-k2-6-quickstart) the model natively accepts `{"type":"image_url"}` and `{"type":"video_url"}` content parts. The gateway message validator rejects non-text content parts (see "Messages contract" below), so image/video inputs never reach vLLM through this path.
  - **CVE-2026-44222 applies if vLLM is started with the multimodal pathway enabled** (which is the default for a VL/multimodal model). A user can still slip the literal string `<|vision_start|>` through text content, and the gateway does not sanitize it today. See `❌ Open / not yet implemented` above — a content sanitizer is required before we knowingly expose this attack surface.

### 🚫 Won't add (out of scope or by design)

- **`model` length cap** — redundant with 10 MiB body cap; minimal benefit on a routing-lookup field.
- **`tags`** — undocumented in any public chat-completions contract we serve (Hermes Agent's API doc explicitly says "standard OpenAI Chat Completions format" — see [hermes-agent api-server.md](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/main/website/docs/user-guide/features/api-server.md); OpenRouter uses structured `metadata` instead — [OpenRouter Chat Completion reference](https://openrouter.ai/docs/api/api-reference/chat/send-chat-completion-request)). Accepting a folk-convention field with no upstream specification means codifying a contract we can't reference. Reject so clients surface the bug cleanly.
- **Provider-specific fields without vLLM semantics that bring no wire-compat value**: see "Unsupported parameters" below for the full categorized list. (Note: `user`, `metadata`, `parallel_tool_calls`, `stream_options`, `safety_identifier`, `service_tier`, `store`, `provider`, `plugins`, `prompt_cache_key`, `extra_headers`, `thinking_config` are all in the Supported table above — silently stripped where the upstream has no semantics. `extra_body` is **unwrapped** rather than stripped. `reasoning_effort` is enum-validated then stripped (no current model is reasoning-capable). `reasoning` is translated into `reasoning_effort` (then stripped). `enable_thinking` is translated into `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking`. All entries have citations in Coercions / Shape validators above.)
- **vLLM-native structured-output bypass** (`guided_json`, `guided_regex`, `guided_grammar`, `guided_choice`, `enforced_tokens`) — would need their own validators; `response_format` covers the same intent with bounds.

## Supported parameters

| Field | Category | Stage / rule | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `model` | string | — | Required. Pass-through. Selects the upstream model id. |
| `stream` | bool | — | Pass-through. Streaming is enabled when `true`. |
| `messages` | object array | message validator + PreValidation length cap (`LengthCapListParameterHandler`) | Required, non-empty. `len(messages) ≤ 2048` (way above any realistic conversation; defense against JSON-parse memory amplification, independent of token count). Strict OpenAI-compatible message contract — see "Messages" section below. |
| `max_tokens` | int range | PostLimits (token-limit pipeline) | If absent → set to `DefaultRequestMaxTokens`. Capped at `RequestMaxTokensCap` unless the request carries admin auth. When both `max_tokens` and `max_completion_tokens` are set, the smaller wins and both are aligned. |
| `max_completion_tokens` | int range | PostLimits (token-limit pipeline) | Same rules as `max_tokens`. |
| `n` | int range | PostLimits sanitize (`CapUintParameterHandler`) + greedy coerce | Capped at `MaxChatRequestChoices` (5). Coerced to `1` when `temperature == 0` (vLLM rejects `n > 1` under greedy sampling). |
| `temperature` | float range | PostLimits sanitize | Strips `NaN`/`±Inf`. Capped at `MaxTemperature` (2.0). String-encoded numbers accepted. |
| `top_p` | float range | PostLimits sanitize | Strips `NaN`/`±Inf`. No upper cap (forwarded raw). |
| `top_k` | int range | PostLimits sanitize | Strips `NaN`/`±Inf`. vLLM-specific. |
| `min_p` | float range | PostLimits sanitize | Strips `NaN`/`±Inf`. vLLM-specific. |
| `repetition_penalty` | float range | PostLimits sanitize | Strips `NaN`/`±Inf`. Capped at `MaxRepetitionPenalty` (2.0). |
| `frequency_penalty` | float range | PostLimits sanitize | Strips `NaN`/`±Inf`. Clamped to `[-2.0, 2.0]`. **Kimi K2.6**: force-rewritten to `0.0` via a `ModelScopedParameterHandler` catalog rule (model accepts only `0.0` on the wire). |
| `presence_penalty` | float range | PostLimits sanitize | Strips `NaN`/`±Inf`. Clamped to `[-2.0, 2.0]`. **Kimi K2.6**: force-rewritten to `0.0` via a `ModelScopedParameterHandler` catalog rule (model accepts only `0.0` on the wire). |
| `logit_bias` | int→float map | PostLimits sanitize (`SanitizeFloatMapParameterHandler`) | Keeps numeric entries in `[-100, 100]`. Drops the field if the map is empty after sanitization. Map size capped at 1024 entries (rejected with HTTP 400 over the cap). |
| `stop` | string list | PreValidation length cap (`LengthCapListParameterHandler`) | Pass-through within bounds. Rejected if `len(stop) > 16` or any entry's string length > 256 bytes. |
| `stop_token_ids` | int list | PreValidation length cap (`LengthCapListParameterHandler`) | Pass-through within bounds. Rejected if `len(stop_token_ids) > 64`. |
| `seed` | int range | PreValidation type-check (`ValidateUintParameterHandler`) | Must parse as a non-negative integer that fits in uint64. Otherwise rejected with HTTP 400 at the gateway boundary instead of relying on the upstream's error path. |
| `skip_special_tokens` | bool | — | Pass-through. vLLM-specific. |
| `detokenize` | bool | — | Pass-through. vLLM-specific. |
| `thinking` | object | PreValidation validate (`paramvalidators.ThinkingValidator`) | Must be `{"type": "enabled" \| "disabled"}`. Any other shape rejected. For `moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6` the validator itself mirrors the resolved boolean into `chat_template_kwargs.thinking` (existing value wins). |
| `chat_template_kwargs` | object | PreValidation validate (`paramvalidators.ChatTemplateKwargsValidator`) | Pass-through within plain-object bounds: depth ≤ 5, nodes ≤ 128, serialized size ≤ 16 KiB. Top-level keys that override `apply_hf_chat_template()` positional arguments are rejected (`chat_template`, `tokenize`, `tools`, `documents`, `conversation`, `continue_final_message`, `padding`, `truncation`, `max_length`, `return_tensors`, `return_dict` — defuses CVE-2025-61620 + CVE-2025-62426). `add_generation_prompt` is explicitly *allowed* as a legitimate template knob. |
| `tool_choice` | string \| object | PreValidation validate | Accepted values: `"auto"`, `"none"`, or `{"type":"function","function":{"name":"..."}}` (name ≤ 64 B). `"required"` is silently coerced to `"auto"` by `ToolsValidator` (temporarily disabled). Other shapes (number, array, unknown string, malformed object) get a 400. Stripped together with `tools` if `tools` arrives empty. If `tools` is non-empty and `tool_choice` is omitted, gateway writes `"auto"` (matches the OpenAI spec). |
| `min_tokens` | int range | PreValidation conditional strip + PostLimits clamp | Dropped if `stop_token_ids` is also set (vLLM rejects the combination). Otherwise clamped to ≤ `max_tokens`. |
| `bad_words` | string list | PreValidation sanitize + length cap | Empty/whitespace strings are removed. Field is dropped if the resulting list is empty. Then `len(bad_words) ≤ 64`, per-entry length ≤ 128 bytes. |
| `tools` | object array | PreValidation sanitize + shape + schema validate (`paramvalidators.ToolsValidator`) | Empty arrays drop both `tools` and `tool_choice`. Each tool must declare `type: "function"` and a `function` object with a non-empty string `name` — the OpenAI tool contract — otherwise rejected before vLLM ever sees the request. If `function.parameters` is present, it is walked as a JSON Schema with bounds depth ≤ 16, nodes ≤ 256, branch arms ≤ 16, enum ≤ 256, size ≤ 16 KiB; `$ref`/`$defs`/`definitions` forbidden; `type` must be a JSON-Schema primitive; `pattern` must compile as a regex within 512 B — CVE-2025-48944. Parameter-less tools are valid. Both depth and node-count limits are wider than `response_format` (16/256 vs 5/128) because production agent tool schemas with nested presentation structures routinely sit at 5–13 levels with up to ~170 nodes; the wider tools bounds give headroom over observed max, while MaxSize=16 KiB, MaxBranch=16, and the `$ref`/`$defs` ban provide the actual schema-bomb defense. |
| `logprobs` | bool | PostLimits force | Forced to `true` for the gateway's observability pipeline regardless of what the client sent. |
| `top_logprobs` | int range | PostLimits force | Forced to `5` for the same reason. |
| `response_format` | object | PreValidation validate (`paramvalidators.ResponseFormatValidator`) | Accepted with bounds. `type` must be one of `text` / `json_object` / `json_schema`. For `json_schema`, the schema is walked once and rejected if depth > 5, nodes > 128, branch arms (anyOf/oneOf/allOf) > 16, enum > 256, serialized size > 16 KiB, or contains `$ref` / `$defs` / `definitions`. Every schema node's `type` must be a JSON-Schema primitive (`string`/`number`/`integer`/`object`/`boolean`/`array`/`null` or an array of those); `pattern` is byte-capped at 512 B and must compile as a regex (defuses CVE-2025-48944). |
| `user` | string | PreValidation validate (`paramvalidators.UserValidator`) | OpenAI-standard end-user identifier for abuse tracking; no inference-side semantics on the vLLM upstream, ignored on the wire. Must be a string; byte-length ≤ 512 (covers production identifiers — `user_<random>`, UUIDs, hashed ids, email-shaped, framework session ids — while preventing the field from being used as a 10 MiB body-size carrier). |
| `metadata` | object | PreValidation validate (`paramvalidators.MetadataValidator`) | OpenAI-standard tracking object (LangSmith, distributed tracing, A/B tagging). Bounded to ≤16 keys × 64-char keys × 512-char string values — the same limits the OpenAI API itself enforces. Values must be strings; any other type rejected. |
| `parallel_tool_calls` | bool | — | Pass-through. OpenAI-standard tool-calling control. Some vLLM versions honor it, some ignore it — the client opted in to that behavioral divergence; no DoS surface. |
| `stream_options` | object | PreValidation validate (`paramvalidators.StreamOptionsValidator`) | Sub-field whitelist. Only `include_usage` survives — the OpenAI-documented opt-in for a final-chunk `usage` object, required by any streaming client that needs token accounting. `continuous_usage_stats` is stripped (triggers vLLM-project/vllm#9028: per-chunk usage counter is wrong under chunked prefill). Any other / future sub-field is also stripped. If the object empties out, the field is dropped entirely so it never reaches the upstream as `{}`. |
| `safety_identifier` | string | PreValidation gate (`ModelScopedParameterHandler` → `paramvalidators.SafetyIdentifierValidator`) | OpenAI is [migrating end-user attribution from `user` to `safety_identifier`](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5428082-how-to-incorporate-a-safety-identifier). Forwarded to `moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6` (Moonshot consumes the field for abuse tracking on their hosted backend) after a string + ≤512 B shape check (gateway-chosen cap, mirroring `UserValidator`; OpenAI does not enforce a hard length). Silently stripped for every other model — no documented downstream consumer on the vLLM-served path. |
| `service_tier` | string | PreValidation strip | Silently stripped at the gateway. OpenAI billing/latency tier routing (`auto`/`default`/`flex`/`priority`); vLLM has a single queue and ignores the field. Accepting + stripping preserves OpenAI SDK wire-compat without implying tier semantics we cannot deliver. |
| `store` | bool | PreValidation strip | Silently stripped at the gateway. OpenAI Stored Completions opt-in; vLLM does not persist completions, so the field is a no-op. Forwarding would create a false retention expectation for eval/distillation pipelines; stripping makes the no-op behavior consistent and auditable. |
| `provider` | object | PreValidation strip | Silently stripped at the gateway. OpenRouter cross-provider routing object; meaningless on a single-backend vLLM path. Pure routing metadata (no URLs, no code paths consumed) so stripping is zero-risk and avoids 400s for OpenRouter-aware clients hitting our endpoint. |
| `plugins` | array | PreValidation strip | Silently stripped at the gateway. OpenRouter edge-only plugin invocation (`web` search, `file-parser`, etc.); never executed downstream on our path. Stripping avoids surfacing a misleading "supported" surface to clients while keeping wire-compat. |
| `prompt_cache_key` | string | PreValidation strip | Silently stripped at the gateway. First-class OpenAI Chat Completions field ([OpenAI API reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create)); also documented by Moonshot for Kimi Code Plan tier ([Moonshot Chat Completion API](https://platform.kimi.ai/docs/api/chat)). vLLM does NOT honor this field — it uses a separate `cache_salt` field for cache isolation ([vLLM RFC #16016](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/16016) / [PR #17045](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/17045)) and the aliasing request is still open ([vLLM Issue #33264](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/33264)). Stripping prevents 400s for cache-aware clients without false isolation promises. Restore as a real feature only if hash → `cache_salt` injection becomes a requirement (note: `cache_salt` is a pure vLLM extension; no mainstream agent SDK emits it). |
| `extra_body` | object | PreValidation unwrap (catalog pre-pass) | **Unwrapped** to the top level of the document before `rejectUnknownParameters` runs, so lifted keys flow through the catalog's normal validation. OpenAI Python SDK convention is to FLATTEN client-side ([openai-python README: "Undocumented request params"](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/README.md#undocumented-request-params)); a literal `extra_body` field on the wire indicates a non-flattening client (e.g. LiteLLM passthrough — [LiteLLM #4769](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/issues/4769)) or hand-rolled code that copied the construct verbatim (e.g. the [Kimi migration guide](https://kimi-ai.chat/guide/openai-to-kimi-api/) example). Lift semantics: top-level keys win on conflict; nested `extra_body` is not lifted; non-object envelopes are silently dropped. Known lifted keys (e.g. `thinking`) reach their validators normally; unknown lifted keys surface as the standard unsupported-field 400. |
| `extra_headers` | object | PreValidation strip | Silently stripped at the gateway. OpenAI Python SDK HTTP-level header injection, documented alongside `extra_body` / `extra_query` ([openai-python README: "Undocumented request params"](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/README.md#undocumented-request-params)); not a body field under correct SDK use. Strip-if-present is a defensive no-op for clients that accidentally serialize it into the body. |
| `reasoning_effort` | enum string | PreValidation validate (`paramvalidators.ReasoningEffortValidator`) + `ModelScopedParameterHandler` strip | Enum: `none|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh` sourced from [vLLM `ChatCompletionRequest.reasoning_effort`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/main/vllm/entrypoints/openai/chat_completion/protocol.py) (vLLM also accepts `"max"` for DeepSeek V4 — excluded here); concept from the [OpenAI reasoning guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/reasoning). Validated then stripped — every currently-routed model is non-reasoning ([Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507) explicitly non-thinking; [Moonshot Kimi](https://platform.kimi.ai/docs/api/chat) schema lacks the field). Re-check strip wiring when adding a reasoning-capable model. |
| `reasoning` | object | PreValidation translate (`paramvalidators.ReasoningValidator`) | Extracts `effort` from the [OpenRouter unified reasoning object](https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/best-practices/reasoning-tokens) and lifts it onto top-level `reasoning_effort`. `enabled: false` is honored as an explicit opt-out (no lift). `max_tokens` / `exclude` / `enabled: true` are silent-dropped — no documented sink on our non-reasoning routes. Wrapper always removed after lift; top-level `reasoning_effort` wins on conflict. |
| `enable_thinking` | bool | PreValidation translate (`paramvalidators.EnableThinkingValidator`) | Translates top-level `enable_thinking` into `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking` per the canonical Qwen3 placement ([Qwen vLLM deployment docs](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/vllm.html): *"passing enable_thinking is not OpenAI API compatible"*). Pre-existing `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking` wins. For Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507 the flag is a documented no-op; harmless and forward-compatible for future Qwen3-Thinking variants. |
| `thinking_config` | object | PreValidation strip | Gemini-native (`thinkingConfig: {thinkingBudget, includeThoughts}` under `generationConfig`). Not in any OpenAI / OpenRouter / vLLM / Moonshot contract we serve — silent-strip lets misconfigured clients pass without breakage. |

### Messages contract (recap)

Enforced by `request_filters_messages.go`:

- Roles: `developer`, `system`, `user`, `assistant`, `tool`, `function`.
- Assistant `content` may be empty/null only when `tool_calls` or `function_call` is present.
- Tool messages require `tool_call_id` matching a prior assistant `tool_calls[].id`.
- Function messages require `name`.
- Content parts: only `{"type": "text", "text": "..."}` is accepted. Typed arrays of text parts are flattened to a single string before forwarding.
- Empty tool `content` is normalized to a sentinel string; missing tool `content` is also normalized.

## Unsupported parameters (rejected)

Every OpenAI / vLLM / provider-specific field that is **not** in the Supported table is rejected at `PreValidation`. The error response is HTTP 400 with body `feature "<name>" is temporarily unavailable`.

Grouped by why the field is off:

| Group | Examples we reject today | Origin | Why off |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Structured-output (non-`response_format`) | `guided_json`, `guided_regex`, `guided_grammar`, `guided_choice`, `enforced_tokens`, `structured_outputs` | vLLM-native | Bypasses the response_format safety bounds. Same grammar-compiler attack surface; would need its own validator. |
| Tool-calling extensions | (none — `parallel_tool_calls` is now passthrough; `tool_choice="required"` is silently coerced to `"auto"` by `ToolsValidator`, see Supported table) | OpenClaw, OpenAI | "required" is temporarily disabled by network policy (cost-amplifier + engine-wedge observed historically). |
| Routing / metadata | `tags`, `seed_override` | Hermes, OpenClaw, Kilo, Nous | `tags` is undocumented in any public chat-completions contract we serve ([hermes-agent api-server.md](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/main/website/docs/user-guide/features/api-server.md), [OpenRouter Chat Completion reference](https://openrouter.ai/docs/api/api-reference/chat/send-chat-completion-request) — neither documents the field). Reject so misuse surfaces cleanly. (`user`, `metadata`, `service_tier`, `provider`, `plugins`, `extra_headers` moved to Supported as silent-strip / shape-validated entries; `extra_body` moved to Supported as the **unwrap** entry — see Supported table.) |
| Caching | — | — | (`prompt_cache_key` and `store` were moved to Supported as silent-strip — vLLM does not honor either, so stripping is the OpenAI-compatible no-op; see Supported table for citations.) |
| Reasoning (non-vLLM-native) | — | — | (`reasoning_effort`, `reasoning`, `enable_thinking`, `thinking_config` were moved to Supported — see Shape validators / Coercions above. `reasoning_effort` validates then strips; `reasoning` translates to `reasoning_effort`; `enable_thinking` translates to `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking`; `thinking_config` is silent-stripped.) |
| Provider-specific extras | `vl_high_resolution_images` (Qwen, when sent via `extra_body`), `messages[].reasoning_content` (Kimi multi-turn replay), `chat_template_kwargs.preserve_thinking` (Qwen wrapper) | Hermes, OpenClaw | Single-vendor attribution / wrapping fields. No vLLM equivalent. Now that `extra_body` is **unwrapped**, lifted inner keys are subject to the standard whitelist — `extra_body.vl_high_resolution_images`, `extra_body.tags` surface as 400 as if they were sent at the top level. (`extra_body.provider`, `extra_body.plugins`, `extra_body.thinking_config` are accepted because their top-level counterparts are silent-stripped on the supported list; `tools[].function.strict` was moved out — silently stripped by `ToolsValidator`, see Coercions.) |

If you see a field here that you need, add it to the catalog with the smallest safe rule — see "Validation improvements".

## How to use the gateway

### Minimal request

```http
POST /v1/chat/completions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
}
```

`max_tokens` is filled in for you (`DefaultRequestMaxTokens`).

### With sampling knobs

```json
{
  "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "top_p": 0.95,
  "top_k": 40,
  "repetition_penalty": 1.05,
  "max_tokens": 512
}
```

All five knobs are sanitized at `PostLimits`: non-finite numbers and out-of-range values are dropped or clamped before the request reaches vLLM.

### With tools (function calling)

```json
{
  "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Weather in Berlin?"}],
  "tools": [
    {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "get_weather",
      "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"city": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["city"]}}}
  ],
  "tool_choice": "auto"
}
```

If `tools` is `[]`, the gateway strips both `tools` and `tool_choice` (the vLLM build we run rejects empty tools).

If `tools` is non-empty but `tool_choice` is omitted, the gateway writes `tool_choice: "auto"` before the request reaches vLLM. This matches OpenAI's documented default and avoids a class of 400s seen in production when clients drop the field and the backend wasn't started with `--enable-auto-tool-choice`.

If `temperature == 0` and `n > 1`, the gateway rewrites `n` to `1` (greedy sampling produces identical completions, and vLLM otherwise rejects the request). Clients receive the response without a 400 and without retries.

### With Kimi-K2.6 thinking

```json
{
  "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Plan this refactor"}],
  "thinking": {"type": "enabled"}
}
```

For `moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6` the gateway also writes `chat_template_kwargs.thinking = true` automatically.

### Rejected request

```json
{
  "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
  "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}
}
```

→ `HTTP 400 — feature "response_format" is temporarily unavailable`. Same shape for any other unknown key.

## Design notes

### `response_format` invariants (reference)

The motivating attack that drove the validator design — a JSON Schema with ~200 nested `properties` levels would crash vLLM:

```json
{
  "response_format": {
    "type": "json_schema",
    "json_schema": {
      "name": "r",
      "schema": {"properties": {"x": {"properties": {"x": {"properties": {"x": "..."}}}}}, "required": ["x"], "type": "object"}
    }
  }
}
```

A safe `response_format` handler must enforce all of the following at `PreValidation` and reject the request with HTTP 400 if any check fails:

| Invariant | Initial threshold | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` ∈ {`text`, `json_object`, `json_schema`} | Hard whitelist | Same set OpenClaw/Kilo document. Anything else → reject. |
| For `json_schema`: `json_schema.name` is a non-empty string ≤ 64 chars, regex `^[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+$` | Hard | vLLM uses the name as a grammar identifier. |
| For `json_schema`: `json_schema.schema` is an object | Hard | Reject arrays/strings/null. |
| Max schema depth | **≤ 5** | Counts nesting through `properties`, `items`, `additionalProperties`, `anyOf`/`oneOf`/`allOf` element schemas, `prefixItems`. The 200-level attack above fails at depth 6. |
| Max serialized schema size | **≤ 16 KiB** | Measured on the marshalled `json_schema.schema` bytes. Bounds memory/time on the vLLM grammar compiler. |
| Max schema node count | **≤ 128** | Each visited schema object (root, every nested property/item/branch arm) counts as one node. Bounds breadth attacks like a single `properties` map with hundreds of children. |
| `$ref`, `$defs`, `definitions` | Forbidden | Prevents cycles and indirect blow-ups. |
| `anyOf`/`oneOf`/`allOf` array length | ≤ 16 | Avoid combinatorial explosion in vLLM's grammar compiler. |
| `enum` length | ≤ 256 | Same reason. |

Order of checks: type → name + regex → walk the schema once, counting depth, nodes, branch arms, enums, refusing on the first violation → only then `json.Marshal` the schema to enforce the byte-size cap. Walking comes first because `json.Marshal` is O(input size); doing it before the walk lets an attacker amplify a 200-level recursive payload into hundreds of allocations before the depth check ever fires. Walking first cuts that path from ~87 µs / 1606 allocs to ~560 ns / 2 allocs (Apple M2 Pro). Single bounded pass — no recursion without a depth counter.

Implementation: `paramvalidators.ResponseFormatValidator` in `cmd/devshardctl/paramvalidators/response_format.go`, wired into the main catalog via `DocumentValidatorHandler` at `RequestFilterStagePreValidation`. The walker policy is *inverted*: it descends into every object-valued or array-of-object-valued field except an explicit list of data carriers (`enum`/`const`/`default`/`examples`/`required`/`dependentRequired`), so new JSON-Schema keywords (`if`/`then`/`contains`/`unevaluatedProperties`/...) cannot smuggle deep nesting or `$ref` past the validator.

### Shared schema-walking infrastructure

Schema-walk rejection categories are exposed as sentinel errors: `ErrSchemaDepth`, `ErrSchemaNodes`, `ErrSchemaSize`, `ErrSchemaRef`, `ErrSchemaEnum`, `ErrSchemaBranch`, `ErrSchemaType`, `ErrSchemaPattern`. They are shared by `SchemaBounds` (JSON-Schema-aware, used for `response_format` and `tools[].function.parameters`) and `ObjectBounds` (plain-object, used for `chat_template_kwargs`).

Calibrate the thresholds (depth, size, nodes) by running the validators against the sample structured-output schemas from production clients before raising any limit.

## Performance characteristics

End-to-end `normalizeChatRequest` (Apple M2 Pro, `-benchtime=2s`, `-count=3`):

| Body | ns/op | B/op | allocs/op |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Minimal (47 B) | 3,140 | 2,428 | 41 |
| Typical (132 B) | 4,963 | 2,926 | 65 |
| Heavy (~620 B) | 21,054 | 12,951 | 240 |
| WithResponseFormat (279 B) | 10,372 | 6,663 | 137 |
| RejectedUnknown (72 B) | 1,948 | 2,148 | 34 |
| **RejectedDeepBody (7.5 KiB body-depth attack)** | **1,093** | **96** | **2** |
| RejectedRecursiveSchema (walker reject) | 8,147 | 7,928 | 100 |

`Heavy` carries `chat_template_kwargs` so `ChatTemplateKwargsValidator` runs. `RejectedDeepBody` trips the body-level pre-scan (depth > 32) before any validator. `RejectedRecursiveSchema` reaches the walker (body depth under cap, schema depth over `MaxDepth=5`) and pays for `json.Unmarshal` — ~8× more expensive than pre-scan reject.

`response_format` validator in isolation (`paramvalidators/response_format_bench_test.go`):

| Path | ns/op | B/op | allocs/op |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Absent | 8.7 | 0 | 0 |
| `type=text` / `json_object` | ~18 | 0 | 0 |
| Simple schema | 1,763 | 536 | 19 |
| At limits (~121 nodes) | 56,734 | 21,252 | 724 |
| Rejects recursion attack | 1,215 | 176 | 4 |
| Rejects oversized schema | 17,402 | 514 | 17 |

`CheckSize` switched from `json.Marshal(schema)` to `json.NewEncoder` over a counting `io.Writer`: same byte total, no marshaled buffer allocation. Saves -14% B/op on `At limits` and -97% on `Rejects oversized` (the 17 KiB schema no longer materializes).

Bench files: `request_filters_bench_test.go` (pipeline-level) and `paramvalidators/response_format_bench_test.go` (validator-level).
